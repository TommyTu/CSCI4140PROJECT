On the most basic level a brand is still about a promise of consistency and a mark of value, but the role of branding is much more complex. Today, there is widespread recognition that brands are more than a logo that stimulates recognition and helps to identify a product or service. Instead we now appreciate that it is the emotional and intangible qualities that underpin the value of a brand.&nbsp; The hospitality sector has been quick to embrace \u201cbrand\u201d in this regard recognizing that these qualities offer the greatest means of competitive advantage. Thus, to not only succeed but to thrive in a competitive landscape, hotels and other service brands in the wider hospitality sector, need to stand out by \u201cstanding for\u201d something. There are now actual processes in place to achieve this. They require a position upon which to build the brand and its reputation, a brand strategy to tell and manage the brand\u2019s story and a business plan with strong competencies and capabilities that create value.&nbsp; The key objective of this course then is to provide an overview on the role of brand (and its constituent parts) in building and sustaining an organization\u2019s reputation and hence competitive advantage.

Also, Hong Kong has many culturally important \u2018ephemeral\u2019 landscapes, relating to the temporary transformation of spaces, for example during religious festivals, or even the more routine transformations that occur at street eateries (dai pai dong) or markets. \r<br />\r<br />This course explores the concept \u201clandscape\u201d, its tangible and intangible dimensions, how they are physically evidenced locally and abroad, and how anthropologists, archaeologists and a myriad of other disciplines approach their study and interpretation. In particular, we will work through a series of local case studies to see what landscape can tell us about the lifeways, economies, politics and beliefs of past and present communities in Hong Kong. By studying cultural landscapes we can also identify what past and present communities, organisations and governments chose to keep and protect and what they let go \u2013 by assessing such processes we can develop an understanding of the underlying socio-political and economic drivers at work through time. In terms of heritage management, therefore, if we wish to militate against the gradual loss of meaning and value in our cultural landscapes, a landscape approach is indicated.", "dropcons": "No", "career": "Undergraduate", "grading": "Graded", "wlnow": "999", "wltotal": "0", "addcons": "No"}, "4658": {"status": "Wait List", "regrequirement": "", "semester": "2017-18 Term 2", "description": "(UGEC2294 is double-coded with CURE2042.)\r<br />\r<br />The course introduces the student a basic knowledge of Xiqu (Chinese Opera), including its artistic features as a performing art, and the characteristics of different kinds of local Xiqu, such as Beijing Opera, Kunqu, Shanghai Opera and Cantonese Opera.

The importance of the wishes of the person who creates the trust, the settler or testator, has also changed as the Court has been willing to vary the terms of the trust in various circumstances. \r<br />\r<br />Apart from trusts, Equity has also provided modern commerce with the basis of professional relationships: the fiduciary. The company director owes a fiduciary duty to the company and the remedies available to the company for his wrongdoings are equitable. Similarly professional duties of confidentiality are based on fiduciary principles.&nbsp; Over the centuries, whereas the common law was restricted to the remedy of damages, Equity developed a series of flexible and powerful remedies, such as: subpoena; equitable account; subrogation; and rescission. Foremost amongst these was the injunction, which can be used to stop someone doing something or make them do it. Equity also developed flexible principles for tracing misappropriated property into the hands of the wrongdoer and third parties. \r<br />\r<br />Throughout the course students will learn to evaluate the part played by equity and trusts in: (1) accommodating the law to elementary requirements of justice and fairness; and (2) the suitability of that accommodation to the social, economic, and historical circumstances of Hong Kong.

This technology is named remote sensing. It has been widely used in the exploration of natural resources, land use, environmental monitoring, disaster analysis, urban development and national defense. This course introduces students of various disciplines to gain a basic understanding of how remote sensing technology can be used to the study of earth surface from a global perspective. The lecturers will use a large amount of remote sensing images to illustrate the changes on the earth surface as a result of natural processes and human activities. According to the nature of the content, the course is divided into three parts: part I: remote sensing: beyond the naked eyes; part II: remote sensing applications in resource and disaster management; and part III: remote sensing as a source of information systems. Through the course study, students will acquire basic knowledge of image capturing, image interpretation and its various applications in our life and society associate with environmental changes on the earth surface.

In such regard, there will be focus on two major dimensions in the course. (1) The first dimension concerns the role of government in public affairs and the challenges it face. (2) The second dimension concerns civil society in general and social movement in particular. There is no question that in recent years civil society and social movements are some of the most popular concepts and controversial phenomena in Hong Kong, Mainland China and elsewhere. One the one hand, the course will discuss the political, social and economic significance of civil society, juxtaposed with the potential pitfalls inherent in the working of government agencies. On the other hand, the rationale, organisation and impact of (new) social movements will be introduced.&nbsp; \r<br />\r<br />Apart from classroom teaching and theoretical discussion, there will be guest speakers and field trips so that the students have opportunities to directly exchange ideas and experiences with government officials, community leaders and social activists.", "dropcons": "No", "career": "Undergraduate", "grading": "Pass/Failure", "wlnow": "999", "wltotal": "0", "addcons": "No"}, "4962": {"status": "Open", "regrequirement": "Pre-requisite: [MATH1010 (or Grade B or above in MATH1510 or MATH1520), 1030 and 1050] or [(ENGG1410 or ESTR1004) and MATH1050].", "semester": "2017-18 Term 2", "description": "This course is to introduce the basic properties of complex functions and analytic functions and to illustrate the important use of these theories to other branches of mathematics and sciences.&nbsp; Topics include: complex numbers; limits, continuity and derivatives, Cauchy-Riemann equations, analytic functions; elementary functions; mapping by elementary functions; Contours integrals, Cauchy-Goursat theorem, Cauchy integral formula, Morera\u2019s theorem, maximum moduli of functions, the fundamental theorem of algebra; Taylor series and Laurent\u2019s series; residues and poles, evaluation of infinite real integrals.\r<br />Advisory: MATH Majors should select not more than 5 MATH courses in a term.", "dropcons": "No", "career": "Undergraduate", "grading": "Graded", "wlnow": "999", "wltotal": "0", "addcons": "No"}, "4965": {"status": "Open", "regrequirement": "", "semester": "2017-18 Term 2", "description": "This course teaches primary spectroscopic techniques used commonly for structure elucidation of organic compounds.

Strategy is typically viewed as a capstone field where the knowledge gained in many different disciplines - such as accounting, marketing, finance, etc. - is integrated with an eye towards their overall impact on organizational effectiveness. We will be using this approach in this course. Our ultimate objective will be to learn how alignment among (internal and external) environmental factors, HR strategy, and HR systems - i.e. systems comprised of HRM practices such as staffing, training, employee development, compensation, empowerment, performance evaluation and work design, etc. - can be aligned to enhance the capacity of hospitality organizations to achieve their strategic goals and objectives. The importance of alignment is magnified in the hospitality industries because within these industries people have the greatest opportunity to impact organizational outcomes.

Although cultural studies has sustained concern on everyday life with mass production, consumerism, sexism, racism and postmodernism, the discipline always lags behind the concern of nature and animal species. As the issues of animal abuse, environmental protection, factory farming, animal protection policy and law-making, as well as media various portrayals being the hot topics of our (post)modern world, the study of animal with the perspective of cultural studies and other humanity disciplines can explore the possibilities of better human-animal relationship. This course is designed with an empathic concern of other-than-human animals. By exploring different issues of human and animals\u2019 life, this course looks for a harmonious balance of nature and modern culture.\r<br />\r<br />This course focuses on three areas, through which we can explore the different aspects of animal and cultural studies. These areas are:\r<br />A.\tEntering Jurassic Park \u2013 Remaking Animals in Leisure\t(Lecture A1-A4)\r<br />B.\tAttacking Godzilla \u2013 Representing Animals in Media\t\t(Lecture B1-B4)\r<br />C.\tFinding Nemo \u2013 Revitalizing Animals in the City\t \t\t(Lecture C1-C4)\r<br />Each area covers a set of animal issue discussion. Area A, apart from theorizing animal with cultural studies, tackles the basic animal issues: pet-nurturing, zoo-building, forest-sustaining and tourism. This is to provide a foundation for understanding animals with a critical reflection of everyday life. \r<br />Area B, set with the concern of media, discusses issues of animal representation in cartoon, cinema, literature and journalism. This is to read how animals would be represented and how this affects human understanding and related policy-making. A screening will be run after Lecture Area B. This is to provide an alternative understanding of animal representation in popular media. \r<br />Area C further deals with the matters of animal-city relationship in seeing how dogs and cats, cattle and swine, and fishes and dolphins are (mal)treated in the street, the farm and the sea respectively. This is to end the course with a leading thought of perfect balance of nature and modernity; and more queries of human-animal relationship will be raised for contemplation.", "dropcons": "No", "career": "Undergraduate", "grading": "Graded", "wlnow": "999", "wltotal": "0", "addcons": "No"}, "5292": {"status": "Open", "regrequirement": "For UG BMEG Major<br />\rPre-requisite: BMEG4998", "semester": "2017-18 Term 2", "description": "The course is designed to provide students with an opportunity to carry out, under the supervision of an academic staff, an independent project with research elements in engineering.", "dropcons": "Department Consent Required", "career": "Undergraduate", "grading": "Graded", "wlnow": "999", "wltotal": "0", "addcons": "No"}, "5293": {"status": "Open", "regrequirement": "Not for Cultural Studies, Religious Studies Majors and students who have taken CURE2051.\r<br />Co-requisite: UGFH1000 or UGFN1000 (only applicable to students admitted to the 4-year curriculum).", "semester": "2017-18 Term 2", "description": "(UGED2326 is double-coded with CURE2051.) \r<br />\r<br />Nowadays comic strip has become one of the major forms of visual narratives in our culture.

The intention is to analyze whether the demise of the Cold War has provided a more favorable time for Japan, China and the US to re-examine WWII in a fresh light. The year 1990 marks a watershed for geopolitics. In that immediately prior to and after 1990, the world witnessed many historical events still thought of as the most significant in recent history, even today. Such events as regards East Asia include the Tiananmen Incident, the burst of Japan\u2019s bubble economy, the disintegration of the USSR and the rise of China. Security concerns among China, Japan and the US changed following 1990 in that Russia is no longer thought of as being a common threat of such primary importance as was the case with its predecessor state, the USSR. There is today a renewed sense of nationalistic assertiveness that can be seen in disputes in and amongst Japan, China and the US over history, territories, military expansion and in conflict over trade between these economic giants. At the same time, in the last twenty years, there have been frequent productions of movies related to WWII in East Asia, on events where differing views of history cause controversy, such as the Nanjing Massacre, Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima. There is therefore importance in investigating to what extent these movies are a reflection of such nationalistic sentiment, as well as the extent to which the WWII theme in filmmaking for a popular market is a tool for groups harboring specific political and ideological agendas. This course emphasizes interdisciplinary research and study methods, including film criticism, history and cultural studies. Students are required to choose a related topic at the beginning of the course and present his/her ideas in the last two lessons.

Although cultural studies has sustained concern on everyday life with mass production, consumerism, sexism, racism and postmodernism, the discipline always lags behind the concern of nature and animal species. As the issues of animal abuse, environmental protection, factory farming, animal protection policy and law-making, as well as media various portrayals being the hot topics of our (post)modern world, the study of animal with the perspective of cultural studies and other humanity disciplines can explore the possibilities of better human-animal relationship. This course is designed with an empathic concern of other-than-human animals. By exploring different issues of human and animals\u2019 life, this course looks for a harmonious balance of nature and modern culture.\r<br />\r<br />This course focuses on three areas, through which we can explore the different aspects of animal and cultural studies.

Area A, apart from theorizing animal with cultural studies, tackles the basic animal issues: pet-nurturing, zoo-building, forest-sustaining and tourism. This is to provide a foundation for understanding animals with a critical reflection of everyday life. \r<br />Area B, set with the concern of media, discusses issues of animal representation in cartoon, cinema, literature and journalism. This is to read how animals would be represented and how this affects human understanding and related policy-making. A screening will be run after Lecture Area B. This is to provide an alternative understanding of animal representation in popular media. \r<br />Area C further deals with the matters of animal-city relationship in seeing how dogs and cats, cattle and swine, and fishes and dolphins are (mal)treated in the street, the farm and the sea respectively.

The family is a domain where unequal gender relationships between men and women are systematically created and reproduced.

On the one hand, the family is an important interactive arena for examining how people produce and do gender, and how gender strategies are created in everyday life.&nbsp; On the other hand, gender is a tool for dissecting the structure of family, its processes, and the outcomes of interactions between its members.&nbsp; This course aims to investigate the complex links between gender and family from a global perspective.

Our modern lives are now largely interwoven with digital technologies that have not only changed our own cultures, but also have brought forth new cultural forms through mobile phone technologies, networked \u201csmart\u201d-products, and cultural groupings only possible through digital means. The course approaches the anthropology of these digital cultures through its main themes\u2014the transformation and expansion of social media, social research online, the intermixing of our online and offline lives, critical social issues of online lives, and the question of posthumanism. These themes are addressed explicitly in the course, and are also the subtexts of the different lectures, readings, and project work. Students will learn the techniques of online fieldwork and referencing. They will explore a diverse array of new ethnographies on social media: on gender, political movements, online dating, hacking, and gaming culture. These ethnographies also serve to model online social research and provide examples of methodology and design. The social consequences of cyberspace are addressed in the topics of internet pornography, addiction, surveillance, activism, and social networking. Gender and identity issues are a continuous theme throughout the course, highlighting how online lives accentuate already existing dynamics. Hong Kong connections to these subjects will also be critically discussed, often drawing on topical themes presented on blogs and forums. Students will learn of the philosophical questions of posthumanism and the nature of technologically mediated human culture. This serves as a philosophical ballast to the course allowing students to reflect personally on their own experiences and how technology has and will continue to shape their lives.

Morality and ethics became a distinct area for anthropological inquiry as recently as the beginning of the 21st century. Why this topic is relatively new in anthropology has something to do with the way in which moral differences have been conflated with cultural differences in the history of the discipline. In other words, anthropologists have long presumed that differences between right and wrong, good and bad, are culturally constructed. In recent years, however, this conflation has been questioned and problematized, with reference to the problem of competing moral goods within a single society and the role of the individual in negotiating moral commitments. Having much to say about cultural differences as well as contingent social processes, anthropologists are now in an even better position to contribute to cross-disciplinary conversations about the nature of morality and ethics. By exploring morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective, this course will demonstrate that morality and ethics is by no means an abstract subject best studied by philosophers. Students will be encouraged to see ethics as a part of their everyday lives, and to see the lives of others as shaped by shared human problems such as how to get along with other people, and how to get along with oneself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r<br />\r<br />This course is divided into four major units. It begins with an issue highly relevant to university students: the responsibility individuals carry for their own success and self-fulfillment in capitalist societies. The second unit considers why moral and cultural differences have been conflated, and how different societies have responded to shared human problems in different ways.&nbsp; The third unit explores the relationship between morality and the creation and maintenance of social relationships. Case studies of small communities in different parts of the world will be especially helpful for understanding morality and ethics from a social perspective, as cooperation can be fragile yet so important in small communities. Topics and readings in the last unit offer resources for enriching and expanding our vocabulary of virtues.

These issues include : What is human existence? What are the values of Chinese Culture? What is the relationship between Chinese Culture and being Chinese? Could we not be a Chinese? Is there contradiction between Chinese Culture and democracy? Is Confucianism a religion? Could Confucianism still provide a kind of ultimate belief for the Chinese today?

These themes are addressed explicitly in the course, and are also the subtexts of the different lectures, readings, and project work. Students will learn the techniques of online fieldwork and referencing. They will explore a diverse array of new ethnographies on social media: on gender, political movements, online dating, hacking, and gaming culture. These ethnographies also serve to model online social research and provide examples of methodology and design. The social consequences of cyberspace are addressed in the topics of internet pornography, addiction, surveillance, activism, and social networking. Gender and identity issues are a continuous theme throughout the course, highlighting how online lives accentuate already existing dynamics. Hong Kong connections to these subjects will also be critically discussed, often drawing on topical themes presented on blogs and forums. Students will learn of the philosophical questions of posthumanism and the nature of technologically mediated human culture.

Where the love poetry of the period frequently idealizes the beloved into a kind of a divinity, Renaissance poetry which ruminates on the nature of mortality frequently does so under the eyes of a God who is, by turns, vengeful and merciful, benevolent and indifferent. While this course is thematic, it also covers many of the formal preoccupations of English Renaissance poetry. Some of these include: imitation, pastoral, paradox, metaphor, and epic form.

Morality and ethics became a distinct area for anthropological inquiry as recently as the beginning of the 21st century. Why this topic is relatively new in anthropology has something to do with the way in which moral differences have been conflated with cultural differences in the history of the discipline. In other words, anthropologists have long presumed that differences between right and wrong, good and bad, are culturally constructed. In recent years, however, this conflation has been questioned and problematized, with reference to the problem of competing moral goods within a single society and the role of the individual in negotiating moral commitments. Having much to say about cultural differences as well as contingent social processes, anthropologists are now in an even better position to contribute to cross-disciplinary conversations about the nature of morality and ethics. By exploring morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective, this course will demonstrate that morality and ethics is by no means an abstract subject best studied by philosophers. Students will be encouraged to see ethics as a part of their everyday lives, and to see the lives of others as shaped by shared human problems such as how to get along with other people, and how to get along with oneself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r<br />\r<br />This course is divided into four major units.

The second unit considers why moral and cultural differences have been conflated, and how different societies have responded to shared human problems in different ways.&nbsp; The third unit explores the relationship between morality and the creation and maintenance of social relationships. Case studies of small communities in different parts of the world will be especially helpful for understanding morality and ethics from a social perspective, as cooperation can be fragile yet so important in small communities.

High-speed rail has reshaped the travel market, promoted tourist destinations and re-defined the competition between air and rail. With its high capacity, greater energy efficiency and relatively lower carbon footprint, high-speed rail is often described as the \u201ctransport mode of the future\u201d due to its contribution to the long-term sustainability of tourism.\r<br />\r<br />The objective of the course is to provide an overview of high-speed rail development in major tourist generating and destination regions in the world, highlighting the key design features and services, tourism-transport relationships, the impact on tourism and destination growth, market competition and major policy considerations addressed by government bodies at the planning and implementation stages. It aims at giving students a new perspective on the rapid transformation of the patterns of inter-regional and international travel brought about by the advancement in railway technology.
